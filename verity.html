      	<div class="content">Why did everyone have to put everything literally to the dump? So, could you just try recycling some stuff. Just look at the packaging to see. So now what do you think of it? Could you just try? So could you do that, just for me?

        <div class="title">The Environment</div>
        <div class="content">Work is not everything in the world, for instance some times work is hurting the environment like taking a bite out of someone like a sister or a mummy. Staring at the screen is bad for your eyes. So now, what to you think about work, is it still everything to you? So have a think about it and I still do not think it is everything to me compared to my family. Until next time!</div>
